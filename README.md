## Description

A web app with the intention for users to be able to log and keep a record of all of their travel memories and find travel inspiration. The user can create travel posts detailing their own personal advice on the location and also they can search for other travellers' posts by country/city and save these to their favourites page. They can create Travel Logs (similar to a travel journal), which are exclusive to that user only. The user can edit and delete their profile and their travel posts and they can also remove their favorites and their travel logs.

Travel experiences should never be forgotten!
